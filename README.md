## Observations. Part I ##
1. Average and median insurance charge differ a lot.
2. We see that the charges for no-child-persons are a bit higher.
3. We see that the more children an individual has the higher the charges.   
4. The smoker person with many children pay LESS than one-or-two-child person.
5. The smoking person with many children has the smallest BMI.
6. The non-smoking persons have bigger BMIs.

## Observations. Part II ##
1. The smoker status impressively increases the insurance charge.
2. The number of children slightly affects the insurance charge. The lowest charge is for persons with 5 kids, the highest if for persons with no kids.
3. Expectedly the older the person the higher the insurance charge.
4. The points are scattered along the graph and there is no distinct trend as regards BMI.
5. The region doesn't affect insurance charge at all.
6. The sex doesn't affect insurance charge at all.
